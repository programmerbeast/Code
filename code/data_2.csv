My experience has gotten progressively worse with every single update for the past several months. It started off as my game freezing when I would try to appraise a Pokemon and eventually go back to normal, but now my game won't open at all even after 30 minutes of removing the app, restarting my phone and trying again. Please fix this";" I spent money."",2,0,0.267.1,2023-04-16 11:58:40,,"

"08ea870c-dac7-47e5-8b71-f5f2fea24f43,R Lowry,""Additions made due to the pandemic actually made the game better and more wide-ranging. However now Niantic wants people to go back in time to before the pandemic, when their game had a blossoming in person community. Those times are gone now. They have raised prices, made in store boxes garbage, and are trying to force players to go back to the way things were. They are now focusing attention on another IP & don't seem to care about the game that made them recognizable. Just a cash cow"",1,0,0.267.1,2023-04-16 11:03:23,,";

The prices of the raid passes are getting higher and now I need to pay more money, 2. Some of the fun things stopped like, legendary birds stopped Appiering at raids, and the new quest are too hard, and mewtwo only shows in raids in the summer.
