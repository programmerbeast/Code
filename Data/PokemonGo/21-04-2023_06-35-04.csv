My experience has gotten progressively worse with every single update for the past several months. It started off as my game freezing when I would try to appraise a Pokemon and eventually go back to normal, but now my game won't open at all even after 30 minutes of removing the app, restarting my phone and trying again. Please fix this; I spent money.",2,0,0.267.1,2023-04-20 11:58:40,,

08ea870c-dac7-47e5-8b71-f5f2fea24f43,R Lowry,"Additions made due to the pandemic actually made the game better and more wide-ranging. However now Niantic wants people to go back in time to before the pandemic, when their game had a blossoming in person community. Those times are gone now. They have raised prices, made in store boxes garbage, and are trying to force players to go back to the way things were. They are now focusing attention on another IP & don't seem to care about the game that made them recognizable. Just a cash cow",1,0,0.267.1,2023-04-20 11:03:23,,

I didn't spend as much as some but I at least forked out $200 over the course of three years trickling down to a few dollars here and there for events.

Add to that they've still not addressed issues/concerns/problems from long ago. There's just so much wrong with it now to recommend quite frankly. I've invested too much time and money on this game to quit forever (as I thought I had in '17 and '19), but the likelihood of me being a permanent, Free-To-Play only casual participant is ever-increasing as I'm now trying.",2,418,0.267.1,2023-04-16 13:05:50,,
