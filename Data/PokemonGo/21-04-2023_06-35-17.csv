Be prepared to waste 6 pokeballs catching it at least. Go buy more. Win streak in pvp? Here's an npc opponent with perfect counter to your team. Go buy and power up another team. Legendary raid?

It was fun and exciting for a long while, but there have been more and more bugs and player-limiting changes recently. Just in the past 6 months, I've submitted several bug/problem reports: 1. 10/16/22 - 2nd free passes weren't granted, completing an elite raid set off the elite raid spawn timer but wild Pokemon were not reachable because they spawned outside the radius of the raid gym. Several research tasks were not completable (you could complete the requirements, but the task would stay on your list, limiting you from picking more up). Reaching out to Niantic resulted in a ""We are currently receiving a high volume of requests"" notice. Niantic's solution was to send a Remote Raid Pass. 2. 11/14/22 - I had a research task to complete a 3* or higher raid. I successfully completed a Guzzlord raid, which is at 5*, and the task was not completed. Niantic support said that Ultra Beasts did not count for this task, but that ""it might get resolved in the future"". 3. 1/4/2023 - I started a special Nidorino (with a party hat) raid in person about 3 minutes with a premium raid pass before it despawned. I successfully completed the raid, but the encounter only showed a normal Nidorino. Niantic support said that the special event ended, most likely when the raid had despawned. If you can't catch a special pokemon, why is the option to do the raid even there? Niantic had no solution, but sent a raid pass. And all of these are just problems in PST timezone; I feel bad for New Zealand players, who bear the brunt of new events since they hit all the bugs. (Zorua + raid bugs - not even being able to get into raids) And that's not to mention the recent price boost to remote raids and the remote raid limit that was recently implemented.

The game is a lot of fun however with Niantics constant ignoring of their player base wishes even after their promise to listen to us. The new price increase and the limit of remote raid passes is making it really hard to even raid with my friends who live in different areas. We coordinate for events to make sure we have good chances for the events and now we all stopped.,1,12,0.265.0,2023-04-12 06:44:38,,

Really not worth playing anymore",1,1,0.265.0,2023-04-12 02:20:20,,

They never disclose rates, legendaries can run away leaving you with worthless items, recent events are boring, new content is added at a snail's pace, game is super buggy, and the recent changes to raiding are absolutely awful. I've uninstalled after playing for the past 2 years and haven't touched it in a month. Genuinely awful management and the game gets progressively worse.",1,1,0.241.0,2023-04-12 02:17:30,,
